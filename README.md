Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This code builds, trains, and fine-tunes a hand gesture recognition model leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture with transfer learning to classify different hand gestures. The model is optimized for accuracy and responsiveness, using techniques like data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout.
